# Culture Images

Place all culture-related images for the guided Culture section here.

- Part a (Dzardzongkha intro) image filename: `culture1.png`
- Path used in code: `assets/images/Culture/culture1.png`
- Note: On macOS, the web/dev server can be case-sensitive depending on tooling. Keep folder name `Culture` with a capital C to match the import.
- If you use a different name, update the `require('../../assets/images/culture/culture1.jpg')` reference in `app/screens/Culture.tsx`.

Recommendations:
- Landscape orientation, at least 1600px width
- `.jpg` or `.png`
- Keep filenames stable to avoid requiring code changes
