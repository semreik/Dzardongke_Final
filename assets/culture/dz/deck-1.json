Like many districts or parts of districts, it was once an autonomous kingdom that was integrated into Nepal during the unification of the country by the Gorkhas in the late 18th century. The Tibetan name for the kingdom founded in the 14th c. is Lo. The district headquarters of Mustang is Jomsom or Dzongsam in the local language called ‘Dzardzongke’. Sam is the Dzardzongke word for “new” and dzong means ‘castle’ so the name of the town of Jomsom means “Newcastle”."

The name of the language is derived from the local name for the Muktinath Valley, Dzardzong Yuldruk, which means the “Six Villages including Dzar and Dzong.” Dzardzongke is similar to other Tibetic languages, especially those spoken nearby like Loke in Upper Mustang. But it also has unique words and grammatical features that are not found in any other variety, not even, for example, in Loke or other Tibetic languages spoken in Nepal or in the more widely used varieties like Standard or Lhasa Tibetan."

Some of these live in the Muktinath Valley, but many have moved to bigger cities like Kathmandu, Hong Kong, Paris or New York. Together with Dzardzongke speakers, we have developed this app to help preserve the Dzardzongke language and the cultural heritage of its speakers. With the app, you can learn about local history and festivals like the dachang ‘arrow-beer’ or the yarthung ‘summer’ festival. You can also use the app to learn to speak the language, or, if you already speak it, you can learn how to write it."

Old Kagbeni was submerged by a massive landslide at some unknown period and moved to its present location, a short distance to the north as the entrance of the Muktinath Valley."

The Pandak River is also a cultural dividing line: villages to the south of it speak Thakali, a Tamangic language in the Tibeto-Burman family. Communities to the north of it speak different varieties of Tibetan or Seke, which is more like Thakali. Currently, Dzardzongke is spoken in the villages of Lubrak, Kagbeni, Khyenga, Chongkor, Dzar, Dzong and Chusang."

Traditionally, the main ceremony was the Demdem Chöpa, which featured dancing, singing, archery and the propitiation of local territorial gods. It is not known when the ceremony used to be celebrated, but the Dachang ceremonies that are held in each of the villages may be the local survivals of this once inter-communal event between multiple villages.

Although Buddhism and Hinduism are found throughout the area, these festivals originally represented older, so-called “pagan” traditions. In recent times, they have become more mixed with other religious traditions. There are three main “pagan” calendrical ceremonies in the Baragaon area, expressed in the following maxim: pi dachang, yar yartung, gun tshongguk “In the spring there is the Dachang; in summer the Yartung, and in winter the Tshongguk.”"

This is the local name for the New Year ceremony according to the agrarian calendar that precedes the main official Tibeto-Mongol calendar by a month. This is the calendar that is observed in most of the villages. It refers to the rule whereby everyone who goes to India for seasonal trade after the buckwheat harvest in October should return to their respective communities by this date. If they didn’t return on time, they had to pay a fine, because it was important to bring bag the trade earnings to the village."
