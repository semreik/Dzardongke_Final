The local calendars of each of the villages do not coincide, however, so this means that the events are staggered over three months, one village at the time. Moreover, even villages that celebrate the Dachang in the same month do not do so on the same dates. The Dachang of Dzar, for example, finishes on the 13th day of the month, the day before the Khyenga Dachang begins. This is usually in March, April or May (10 April in 2025)."

Early morning a small herd of seven or eight yaks is brought down to the village. The Khyenga community only need one, but it is impossible to bring a single animal down from the pasturelands - they won’t leave their companions."
